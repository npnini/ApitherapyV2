Informed Consent Document for Apitherapy Treatment
Apitherapy is the art of healing using honeybee products, including: honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly, beeswax, and bee venom. The patient and the apitherapist must build a relationship of trust between them for the purpose of joint work and the success of the treatment.
I, {{patientName}} ID: {{identityNumber}} (hereinafter: "The Patient") undertake, agree, declare, and confirm that:
Apitherapy is not a treatment method recognized by the Israeli Ministry of Health as a medical treatment.
Apitherapy treats the body and mind.
The Israeli Ministry of Health is not familiar with information and studies conducted in Apitherapy.
I am aware that during and/or as a result of the treatment, problems may arise, including but not limited to: itching, swelling, inflammation, wounds, temporary discomfort, and allergic reaction.
It has been clarified to me that an allergic reaction may manifest in various responses, ranging from a skin rash to total anaphylactic shock, including: breathing difficulties, loss of consciousness, and even death (if not treated correctly and promptly). Should I have an allergic reaction of any kind, I authorize and instruct irrevocably {{caretakerName}} 
("The Apitherapist" or "The Caregiver") to provide me with antihistamine medications according to their sole discretion if necessary—including an Epiphen injection.
The Apitherapist has not given or presented to me guarantees of any kind regarding the results and/or effectiveness of the treatment in Apitherapy.
I have decided, of my own volition, following recommendations I received and after preliminary examinations I conducted on the subject, to treat myself using Apitherapy in order to achieve relief from pain, health enhancement, and/or improvement of my physical and mental state, without relying on representations that the Apitherapist presented to me, if any were presented.
I have presented to the Apitherapist, in full, my entire medical/health history, including problems, treatments, and surgeries I have undergone, medications I have taken and am currently taking. Additionally, I confirm that I do not need to take beta-blocker medications.
In addition to my examinations and the recommendations I received, and without prejudice to the stated in section 7, and after deciding to treat myself using Apitherapy, I confirm that the Apitherapist gave me full information about the treatment plan, and I received from them a clear and comprehensive explanation regarding the risks involved in Apitherapy treatment, which, as stated, can even lead to death. I have discussed the subject with the Apitherapist and I am satisfied with the information in my possession and that which I received from the Apitherapist, and I have all the information required for me to understand the risks and the benefit of the treatment, and I take upon myself exclusively full responsibility for the results of the treatment, and I waive finally and irrevocably any claim and/or demand and/or lawsuit against the Apitherapist regarding the success and/or effectiveness and/or results of the treatment.
